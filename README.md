Underwater Arena Shooter

## Basic Idea

The idea is to create an old school type of arena shooter with elements from newer iterations of the genre.
Mostly inspired by the gameplay loops and game design of Painkiller and DOOM Eternal.

There will be 3 different weapons: a standard double barreled shotgun, a harpoon launcher + hook and a micro missile torpedo launcher.

All weapons should combine well together with the movement and level design, while synergising with the core player health system.
The core player health system should include an oxygen meter which does not deplete on it's own, but only when the player uses movement abilities. 
The main movement ability will be either a double/triple jump or a jetpack.
Oxygen should depending on its current quantity regenerate HP actively.
Oxygen will be replenished through world pickups or close quarters kills on enemies, incentivizing the coined "Push forward combat" style of gameplay.
